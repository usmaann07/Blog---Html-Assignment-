    <h1>HYBRID CAR</h1>
    <!-- Home Section -->
    <blockquote>
        Hybrid cars are modern vehicles that use both a traditional petrol or diesel engine along with an electric
        motor.
        This dual system allows them to save fuel, reduce harmful emissions, and provide smoother performance.
        They are especially efficient in city driving where the electric motor can work more, lowering fuel use.
        Because of their eco-friendly design and cost-saving benefits, hybrid cars are becoming increasingly popular
        worldwide.

    <blockquote>

        Hybrid cars are considered one of the most important innovations in the automobile industry because they bring
        together two different sources of power in a single vehicle: a conventional internal combustion engine (which
        usually runs on petrol or diesel) and an electric motor powered by batteries. By combining these two systems,
        hybrid cars are able to deliver better performance, improved fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions compared to
        traditional vehicles. When driving at lower speeds or in heavy traffic, the electric motor can power the car,
        saving fuel and producing little to no pollution. At higher speeds or when more power is needed, the petrol or
        diesel engine takes over, ensuring smooth and reliable performance. Some advanced hybrid cars can even charge
        their batteries automatically through regenerative braking, a system that stores energy whenever the brakes are
        applied.

        The popularity of hybrid cars is growing rapidly around the world because people are becoming more aware of the
        harmful effects of vehicle emissions on the environment and the rising cost of fuel. These vehicles offer
        drivers a chance to save money on fuel in the long run while also playing a role in protecting the environment.
        Hybrid technology is seen as a bridge between traditional cars and fully electric vehicles, providing a balance
        of convenience, performance, and eco-friendliness. In many countries, governments are also encouraging the use
        of hybrid cars by offering tax benefits, subsidies, and special incentives. With their modern design, fuel
        savings, and environmental benefits, hybrid cars represent a step forward toward a cleaner, greener, and more
        sustainable future in transportation. <br><br>
